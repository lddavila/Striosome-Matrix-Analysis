-Granger Causality can be used to measure if two time series are related to each other by detecting correlation
-granger causality has nothing to do with patterns
-first pattern is spikes going up
-other pattens include spikes going down
-he created distributions of these patterns
-if you're in the right percentile 

-the question is what we call excitation and what we call inhibition
-We need to identify what we call slow and what we call fast
-Once you determine what thresholds you want to use then you can start pattern analysis
-Keep in mind that different types of neurons can have different thresholds
-for example striosomes may have a higher threshold then matrix neurons
-sometimes differences may be very minor
